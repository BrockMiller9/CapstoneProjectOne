1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
I am looking to create a website that gives users the opportunity to discover books and create reading-lists. This will be a site users can create an active reading list with access to book information including a short summary of every book. 

2. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
Since books are read in many demographics I believe this could be used by a diverse group of people. I would assume someone that enjoys reading and is also tech savvy, someone that would rather have something digital rather than on pen and paper.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. 
Through the google books api I aim to use title, author, image, genre, and summary/description of the book.

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later).
Database schema attached in separate file. 
I plan on creating a site that allows users to sign up for an account. While signed in users are able to save books to a reading list and browse other books. There will be a home page that displays a list of books categorized by genre. This will allow the user to discover new books to add to a reading list. There then will be a reading list with each user’s saved books to read. Users will have the ability to click on the ‘card’ of a book that will take them to a new page that displays all the available information about the book and also any related books they might be interested in.
